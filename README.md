# CrimeRisk

A machine learning project for crime risk analysis and visualization.

## Tech Stack

`Python` `Jupyter Notebook` `Pandas` `Scikit-learn` `Machine Learning`

## Overview

This repository contains tools and models for analyzing and predicting crime risk patterns using data science techniques.

## Project Structure

- `train.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook for training machine learning models

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt or notebook dependencies)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open `train.ipynb` to run the training pipeline

## Usage
